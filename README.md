Git Shortcuts
-------------
```
alias gs   = 'git status'
alias gsi  = 'git status --ignored'
alias ga   = 'git add'
alias agd  = 'git add'
alias apgd = 'git add -p'
alias gb   = 'git branch'
alias gbv  = 'git branch -a -v' # shows both local and remote branches AND verbose
alias gc   = 'git commit --verbose'
alias gd   = 'git diff'
alias gds  = 'git diff --staged'
alias gdno = 'git diff --name-only'
alias gdsno = 'git diff --staged --name-only'
alias go   = 'git checkout'
alias gl   = 'git lg' # Mapped to custom alias
alias gd-  = 'git d-' # Mapped to custom alias

git lg     = Display pretty color one-line log with branches, commits, and tags.

git d-     = Delete Previous branch

git drb <branchname> = Delete branch from remote origin
	- branchname defaults to currently active local branch name

git pf     = Push --force-with-lease
git please = Push --force-with-lease

git branch-clean = Remove both:
	- any branches already merged into current branch
	- any branch with a remote that has been removed from origin

git move <branchname> [<number of commits>]
	= Move the most recent commit(s) to the branch "branchname"
		- if "branchname" does not exist create it
		- "number of commits" we are moving is optional and defaults to 1

git cfixup <commit> = commit --fixup <commit>

git csquash <commit> = commit --squash <commit>


git track-origin-same-branch-name = !git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/`git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`
	- sets current branch tracking to origin/<name-of-current-branch>

git delete-merged-on-origin = !git branch --all --merged remotes/origin/master | grep --invert-match master | grep --invert-match HEAD | grep "remotes/origin/" | cut -d "/" -f 3- | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
	- delete all branches on remote "origin" that have been merged into "origin/master"

git delete-remote-tracking-branch <local branch> = !git push $trackingRemote --delete $trackingBranch;
	- delete the remote tracking branch that corresponds to the given local branch
	- <local branch> defaults to the current branch

# gpr 96, will fetch PR 96 create branch pull-request-96
gpr () { git fetch origin pull/$1/head:pull-request-$1; }
```

Included Components
-------------------
* bash/zsh completion support for core Git by Shawn O. Pearce <spearce@spearce.org>
* bash/zsh git prompt support by Shawn O. Pearce <spearce@spearce.org>
* Effortless Ctags git hooks by Tim Pope

Git project template
--------------------
The sub-directory `git_template` acts as a template when creating or cloning a repo.

Exuberant Ctags*
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is an optional feature for advanced users who want to use
[Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/).  If your editor/IDE uses ctags for
integration across files in a project, this will regenerate ctags after commits, merges, and checkouts.
Users who are not interested in these features can ignore this section.
The scripting in these hooks fails silently if
Exuberant Ctags is not installed.
This is based on Tim Pope's work [Effortless Ctags with Git](http://tbaggery.com/2011/08/08/effortless-ctags-with-git.html)

Installation Notes
------------------
* Installation adds `source  ~/ironcode-git-enhancements/bash_profile-mods.bash` to your .bash_profile
* The scripts will be loaded in all future terminal sessions.
If you want to apply them in your current terminal session can apply them now with
the following from the command line  
`source ~/ironcode-git-enhancements/bash_profile-mods.bash`
* Installation modifies your `~/.gitconfig` to use the included template directory
when initializing or cloning a repository

Uninstall
---------
* Edit `~/.bash_profile` in your home directory and remove the line  
`source  ~/ironcode-git-enhancements/bash_profile-mods.bash`
* Edit `~/gitconfig` in your home directory and remove the line  
`templatedir = ~/ironcode-git-enhancements/git_template`
* At this point, the modifications are uninstalled and optionally
you can delete the directory and contents `~/ironcode-git-enhancements`
